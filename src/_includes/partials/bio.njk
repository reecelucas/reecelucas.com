          I'm a firm believer that the web should work for everyone. I'm happiest when I'm working on problems relating to performance,
          accessibility and scalability; especially when I'm alongside good, passionate people.

          Like most front end developers, I spend a lot of my time writing JavaScript, especially React, and the teams
          I work with tend to embrace the latest technologies, techniques and approaches.

          I've been fortunate enough to work with some brilliant organisations, and I hope to keep it that way.
          If you'd like to work together, or if you have any questions about the work Iâ€™ve done,
